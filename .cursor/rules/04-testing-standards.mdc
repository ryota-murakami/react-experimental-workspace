# Testing Standards

## E2E Testing
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Tests should be in the `e2e` directory
- Follow the [playwright.config.ts](mdc:playwright.config.ts) configuration

## Test Structure
- Tests should cover both happy paths and negative cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- For complex interactions, use page objects
