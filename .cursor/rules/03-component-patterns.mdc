# Component Patterns

## Structure
- Each page component should be in its own file in the `src/pages` directory
- Reusable components should be in the `src/components` directory
- UI components should be in the `src/components/ui` directory

## Patterns
- Use React.lazy for code splitting page components
- Use Suspense for loading states
- Pages should follow a consistent structure
- Form handling should use react-hook-form with zod validation
- API calls should use axios
- For complex state management, use signals from @preact/signals-react
